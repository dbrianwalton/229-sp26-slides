  <title>Section 4.1: Experimental and Observational Studies</title>

  <slide>
    <title>Key Ideas</title>

    <p>
      Chapter 4 is about how data are collected and how that influences what types of conclusions we can create.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Two broad classes of studies: <term>experimental studies</term> and <term>observational studies</term>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be able to identify whether a study was experimental or observational.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Discuss advantages and challenges of each type of study.

    <title>Experimental Studies</title>
    
    <p>
      In an <term>experimental study</term>, a researcher <em>assigns</em> subjects to experimental conditions and then observes the response variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assigned experimental conditions are called <term>treatments</term>.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Observational Studies</title>
    
    <p>
      In an <term>observational study</term>, a researcher <em>observes</em> the values of both the explanatory variables and the response variable for all study subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is <em>done</em> to the subjects. They are just observed.
    </p>

    <title>Identify the Study Type: Drug Testing and Student Drug Use</title>
    
    <p>
      A headline read: “Student Drug Testing Not Effective in Reducing Drug Use” in a news release from the University of Michigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facts about the study:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>76,000 students nationwide</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>497 high schools, 225 middle schools</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Some included schools tested for drugs, others did not</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Each student filled out a questionnaire about his/her drug use</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Comparison of Advantages/Challenges</title>
    
    <p>
      Lurking variables
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Observational study: The researcher is at the mercy of how they are distributed among the subjects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Experiment: Randomization during treatment assignment can reduce potential for impact.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Cause and effect
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Observational study: Might find an association, but association does not imply causation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Experiment: Directly manipulating treatments allows research to study effect of explanatory variable.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Practicalities
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Not ethical to expose some subjects to something that we suspect might be harmful (assign treatment), but observations of existing exposure is reasonable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Subjects can be unreliable to follow a treatment protocol, especially over long time periods. Observing behavior does not require strict control.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Experiment may take too long, but observation can look at older records.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Cautions about Anecdotes</title>
    
    <p>
      Informal observations are called <term>anecdotes</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no way to determine if anecdotes are <term>representative</term> of what happens for an entire population.
      <q>The plural of anecdote is not data</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not draw conclusions from anecdotal evidence. Reputable studies adopt <term>methodologies</term> to ensure that their data <em>is</em> representative.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Expectations for good graphs: axes, labels, and showing <m>y=0</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using easily recognized representations: bars, lines or points
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Failures to use effective strategies are often difficult to interpret or intentionally deceiving

    <title>Guidelines for Effective Graphs</title>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Label both axes and provide proper headings.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To compare relative size, it is important to show <m>y=0</m>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Irregular shapes, especially those using different <em>area</em> are difficult to read. Stick with bars, lines, and points. (This includes pie charts.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If two different groups have drastically different values, don't try to put them on a single graph. Consider different graphs, or plot relative sizes such as using percentages or ratios.</p>
      </li>

      <shortdescription>Graph showing recruitment of STEM majors, shown using scaled pictures of people, one representing all students per year, the other person scaled relative to the number of STEM students. The scale of the people figures is difficult to interpret. Caption in image: "Enrollment since 2004 has risen by more than 4000 students. At the same time, the number of STEM majors has dipped just about every year."</shortdescription>

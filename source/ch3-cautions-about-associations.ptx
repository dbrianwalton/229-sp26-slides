    <title>Extrapolation is Dangerous</title>
    
    <p>
      Reminder: <term>extrapolation</term> is when we use the regression line to make predictions for <m>x</m>-values outside the observed range of values.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Riskier the farther we move from the range
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            No guarantee the relationship will continue to be linear
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Influential Outliers</title>
    
    <sidebyside widths="60% 30%">
      <p>
        A <term>regression outlier</term> is an observation that lies far away from the trend relative to other data points.
        You should always plot the data to see if there might be outliers or other unusual observations.

    </sidebyside>

    <p>
      An outlier is an <term>influential outlier</term> if:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>its <m>x</m>-value is relatively high or low compared to the remainder of the data (far from center horizontally)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>its <m>y</m>-value is relatively far from the trend compared to the remainder of the data</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Effect of Influential Outliers</title>
    
    <p>
      The effect of influential outliers is to pull the regression line toward that data point and away from the rest of the data points.
      It tends to make the slope steeper than it would be without that observation.
    </p>

    <title>Correlation Does Not Imply Causation</title>

    <p>
      In a regression analysis, suppose that as <m>x</m> goes up, <m>y</m> also tends to go up (or down). Can we conclude that there is a causal connection, with changes in <m>x</m> <em>causing</em> changes in <m>y</m>?
    </p>
    <p>
      NO!
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A strong correlation between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> means that there is a strong linear association that exists between the two variables.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A strong correlation between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> does not mean that <m>x</m> causes <m>y</m> to change.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of suspicious associations:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>High correlation between monthly ice cream sales and monthly drownings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>High correlation between shoe size and reading level</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Lurking Variables</title>
    
    <p>
      A <term>lurking variable</term> is a variable, usually unobserved, that influences the association between the variables of primary interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lurking variables often capture a hidden link that explains the correlation:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Ice cream sales and monthly drownings more likely in hot weather</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Shoe size and reading level both increase with age</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      That is, the lurking variable may itself be the hidden causal link.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Lurking Variables and Confounding</title>
    
    <p>
      In practice, there are multiple causes for outcomes, often related to one another. It can be difficult to study the effect of individual variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      When two explanatory variables are both associated with a response variable but are also associated with each other, there is said to be <term>confounding</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Lurking variables</term> are not measured in a study. They have the <em>potential</em> to be <term>confounding</term> if they were measured.
    </p>

    <title>Association Does Not Imply Causation</title>
    
    <p>
      The principle extends to <em>all</em> associations, not just linear regression.

    <title>Simpson's Paradox</title>
    
    <p>
      A <term>paradox</term> refers to an apparent contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simpson's paradox occurs when the direction of an association between two variables changes after we include a third variable (often categorical) and analyze the data at separate levels of that third variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baseball example: Compare the 1995 and 1996 batting averages for Derek Jeter and David Justice. If we combine the years, the order reverses.

    <title>Smoking and Health</title>
    
    <p>
      A longitudinal study about smoking followed 1,314 women, 582 of whom smoked and 732 of whom did not.
      The study recorded how many of these individuals were still alive 20 years later.
    </p>
    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">

    <p>
      Is there an association between the variables? Does survival favor smokers or non-smokers?

    <title>Smoking and Health: Conditional Proportions</title>
    
    <p>
      To compare categories, we need to look at the conditional proportions given the smoking status.
    </p>
        <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Smoker</cell><cell>Dead</cell><cell>Alive</cell>

    <title>Smoking and Health: Lurking Variables</title>
    
    <p>
      Age is a lurking variable in our analysis. The summary grouped all ages together, but death is more likely for the older population.
      Different age groups also had different proportions that smoked.

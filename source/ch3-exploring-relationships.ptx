    <title>Associations</title>
    
    <p>
        Chapter 3 Introduction: The main purpose of data analysis with two variables is to investigate whether there is an association and to describe that association.
    </p>
    <p>
        An <term>association</term> exists between two variables if particular values for one variable are more likely to occur with certain values of the other variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <term>response variable</term> is the variable whose outcome is being compared. (The algebra idea here would be the <term>dependent variable</term>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The <term>explanatory variable</term> is the variable for which we want to see if its value affects the distribution of the response. If there is a cause/effect relation, the cause is usually the explanatory variable.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For a <term>categorical</term> explanatory variable, we consider how the distribution might change for the different categories (factors).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For a <term>quantitative</term> explanatory variable, we consider how the distribution changes with different values.

    <title>Contingency Tables</title>
    
    <p>
        A <term>contingency table</term> displays two categorical variables and associated counts for each pair <m>(x,y)</m> possible.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Rows: list the categories of one variable (usually explanatory).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Columns: list the categories of second variable (usually response).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Entries: count or <term>frequency</term> for the combination of variables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>May also have extended table showing row and column sums. These are called the <term>margins</term>.</p>

            <p>
                A simple <term>proportion</term> for a combination of values is the ratio of a single cell to the <em>overall total</em>. 
                <md> P(\text{conventional and pesticide present}) = \frac{7086}{26698} \approx 0.2654 </md>

        <li>
            <p>
                A <term>conditional proportion</term> is the ratio a single cell to a <em>row total</em> or <em>column total</em>, depending on which variable is considered given.
                <md> 
                    <mrow>P(\text{pesticide not present given conventional}) = \frac{7086}{26571} \approx 0.2667 </mrow>

    <title>Table of Conditional Proportions</title>
    
    <p>
        Treating the row variables as the explanatory variables (conditioned on rows), the conditional proportions can be used to fill a new table. To be complete, we should show the total frequency or sample size for the row to be able to recreate the original table. 
    </p>
    <tabular>
        <row header="yes">
            <cell>Food Type</cell>
            <cell>Pesticide Present</cell>
            <cell>Pesticide Not Present</cell>
            <cell></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
            <cell>Organic</cell>
            <cell>0.23</cell>
            <cell>0.77</cell>
            <cell><m>n=127</m></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
            <cell>Conventional</cell>
            <cell>0.73</cell>
            <cell>0.27</cell>
            <cell><m>n=26,571</m></cell>
        </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
        Notice that the sum of each row equals 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should be able to recreate the original counts by multiplying a conditional probability times the sample size <m>n</m> for the appropriate row.
    </p>
    <p>
        The variables <term>have an association</term> if the conditional proportions are <em>different</em> for the different rows. There is <term>no association</term> if the conditional proportions are the <em>same</em>.
    </p>

  <slide>
    <title>Visualize with Bar Charts (Begin Day 9)</title>
    
    <p>
        Side by side bar charts or stacked bar charts are often used to visualize the conditional proportions. See Figs 3.2 and 3.3 from the textbook:
    </p>
    <sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
        <image source="images/ch-3-food-type-with-association.png">
            <shortdescription>Bar chart using actual data showing different proportions for presence of pesticides in organic vs conventional foods</shortdescription>
        </image>
        <image source="images/ch-3-food-type-without-association.png">
            <shortdescription>Bar chart that is hypothetical showing the same proportions for presence of pesticides organic vs conventional foods</shortdescription>
        </image>
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
        If there is <em>no association</em>, we would expect the proportions to be the same. If there <em>is</em> an association, we would see a different distribution for the two categories.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Comparison by Percentage Points</title>
    
    <p>
        A <em>difference</em> in proportions or percentages is reported as <term>percentage points</term>. Subtract one percentage from the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Comparison Example</em>: Of students who entered JMU in 2018, 79.7% graduated within 6 years. Of students who entered Virginia Tech in 2018, 86% graduated within 6 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because 86%-79.7% = 6.3%, we say Virginia Tech has a graduation rate that is 6.3 <term>percentage points</term> higher than JMU.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Comparison by Percent Change</title>
    
    <p>
        A <term>percent change</term> is defined by a formula of the change divided by the reference value:
        <md>
            \text{Percent Change (%)} = \frac{\text{new value} - \text{base value}}{\text{base value}} \times 100\%
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Comparison Example</em>: Of students who entered JMU in 2018, 79.7% graduated within 6 years. Of students who entered Virginia Tech in 2018, 86% graduated within 6 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Virginia Tech has a graduation rate that is 7.9% <em>higher than</em> JMU (base value):
        <md>
            \text{Percent Change (%)} = \frac{0.86 - 0.797}{0.797} \times 100\% \approx 7.9\%
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        JMU has a graduation rate that is 7.3% <em>lower than</em> Virginia Tech (base value):
        <md>
            \text{Percent Change (%)} = \frac{0.797 - 0.86}{0.86} \times 100\% \approx -7.3\%
        </md>
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Comparison by Ratio of Proportions/Percents</title>
    
    <p>
        A <term>ratio</term> is calculated by simple division of the new value divided by the reference value:
        <md>
            \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{new value}}{\text{base value}}
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Comparison Example</em>: Of students who entered JMU in 2018, 79.7% graduated within 6 years. Of students who entered Virginia Tech in 2018, 86% graduated within 6 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Virginia Tech has a graduation rate 1.079 times the JMU rate (base value):
        <md>
            \text{Percent Change (%)} = \frac{0.86}{0.797} \approx 1.079
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is common to report <term>percent change</term> when the ratio is between 0.5 and 2, but to report the ratio directly outside of that range.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Section 3.2: Association Between Two Quantitative Variables</title>
    
    <p>
        We analyze how the response (dependent) variable <em>tends</em> to change as the value of the explanatory (independent) variable changes. If there is no tendency to change, there is no association.
    </p>
    <p>
        We usually try to describe the way the variables change with each other through a <term>formula</term>, in which case we say there is a <term>relationship</term> between the variables. (This is more precise than just an association.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Because data has variability, we will be describing an average or expected relationship. Unusual observations (like outliers) may significantly affect results.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Distributions of Two Quantitative Variables</title>
    
    <p>
        The textbook dataset on "Internet Use" includes internet and Facebook penetration (use) in 32 countries.
        Looking at their distributions separately is informative, but it does not say anything about their association. (Textbook Figure 3.5)

    <title>The Scatterplot: Looking for a Trend</title>
    
    <p>
        A <term>scatterplot</term> is a graph that will reveal the <term>relationship</term> between two quantitative variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the potential association, each <term>observation</term> consists of a value for each variable.

    <title>How to Examine a Scatterplot</title>
    
    <p>
        The goal for a scatterplot was to examine the relationship between two variables. We need some terminology for describing our relationship.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Trend</term>: Describing the general shape of the relationship, such as <em>trend is linear</em>, <em>trend is curved or nonlinear</em>, <em>trend shows clusters</em>, or <em>shows no pattern</em>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Direction</term>: positive, negative, or no direction
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Strength</term>: Describes how closely the points fit the trend. A <term>strong relationship</term> has points close to the trend; a <term>weak relationship</term> shows points spread far away from the trend
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The word <term>correlation</term> is specifically associated with the strength of a linear relationship. Do not use it for nonlinear relationships or categorical associations.

    <title>Strength of Relationship</title>

    <p>
        The <term>strength</term> of the relationship characterizes how closely the response variable matches the trend compared to the overall variability of the explanatory variable. It is observed by how tightly the data points match the trend.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a <term>linear trend</term>, the <term>(linear) correlation coefficient</term> provides a quantitative measure of strength.

        <li>
            <p>Value of <m>r</m> always falls between -1 and 1</p>

        <li>
            <p>The value of <m>r</m> does not depend on which variable is explanatory and which is response.</p>

        <li>
            <p>Correlation is <em>not resistant</em> to outliers, and outliers can greatly influence <m>r</m>.</p>

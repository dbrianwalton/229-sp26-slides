    <title>Associations</title>
    
    <p>
        Chapter 3 Introduction: The main purpose of data analysis with two variables is to investigate whether there is an association and to describe that association.
    </p>
    <p>
        An <term>association</term> exists between two variables if particular values for one variable are more likely to occur with certain values of the other variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <term>response variable</term> is the variable whose outcome is being compared. (The algebra idea here would be the <term>dependent variable</term>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The <term>explanatory variable</term> is the variable for which we want to see if its value affects the distribution of the response. If there is a cause/effect relation, the cause is usually the explanatory variable.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For a <term>categorical</term> explanatory variable, we consider how the distribution might change for the different categories (factors).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For a <term>quantitative</term> explanatory variable, we consider how the distribution changes with different values.
                </p>

    <title>Identify the Explanatory and Response Variables</title>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Consider the association between carbon dioxide levels and the amount of gasoline use for automobiles.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Consider college students' GPA values and the number of hours a week spent studying.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Consider food type (organic or conventional) and the presence of pesticides on the food (present or not).

        You will need to be able to:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Read and interpret contingency tables</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Calculate and interpret proportions and conditional proportions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create and interpret side-by-side bar charts and stacked bar charts and what we would expect if there is or is not an association</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Calculate and interpret the meaning of percentage point difference, percent change, and ratios of proportions to describe associations.</p>

    <title>Contingency Tables</title>
    
    <p>
        A <term>contingency table</term> displays two categorical variables and associated counts for each pair <m>(x,y)</m> possible.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Rows: list the categories of one variable (usually explanatory).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Columns: list the categories of second variable (usually response).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Entries: count or <term>frequency</term> for the combination of variables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>May also have extended table showing row and column sums. These are called the <term>margins</term>.</p>

                A simple <term>proportion</term> for a combination of values is the ratio of a single cell to the <em>overall total</em>. 
                <md> P(\text{conventional and pesticide present}) = \frac{7086}{26698} \approx 0.2654 </md>

                A <term>conditional proportion</term> is the ratio a single cell to a <em>row total</em> or <em>column total</em>, depending on which variable is considered given.
                <md> 
                    <mrow>P(\text{pesticide not present given conventional}) = \frac{7086}{26571} \approx 0.2667 </mrow>
                    <mrow> P(\text{conventional given pesticide not present}) = \frac{7086}{7184} \approx 0.9864 </mrow>

    <title>Table of Conditional Proportions</title>
    
    <p>
        Treating the row variables as the explanatory variables (conditioned on rows), the conditional proportions can be used to fill a new table. To be complete, we should show the total frequency or sample size for the row to be able to recreate the original table. 
    </p>
    <tabular>
        <row header="yes">
            <cell>Food Type</cell>
            <cell>Pesticide Present</cell>
            <cell>Pesticide Not Present</cell>
            <cell></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
            <cell>Organic</cell>
            <cell>0.23</cell>
            <cell>0.77</cell>
            <cell><m>n=127</m></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
            <cell>Conventional</cell>
            <cell>0.73</cell>
            <cell>0.27</cell>
            <cell><m>n=26,571</m></cell>
        </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
        Notice that the sum of each row equals 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should be able to recreate the original counts by multiplying a conditional probability times the sample size <m>n</m> for the appropriate row.
    </p>
    <p>
        The variables <term>have an association</term> if the conditional proportions are <em>different</em> for the different rows. There is <term>no association</term> if the conditional proportions are the <em>same</em>.

    <title>Visualize with Bar Charts</title>
    
    <p>
        Side by side bar charts or stacked bar charts are often used to visualize the conditional proportions.

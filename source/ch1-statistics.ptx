    <title>Major Components of Statistics Methods</title>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Design: State goal/question and plan how to collect data</p></li>
        <li><p>Description: Summarize and analyze the data</p></li>
        <li><p>Inference: Make decisions and predictions to answer question</p></li>

    <p>
        Builds on a foundation of <em>probability</em>, which is a framework for quantifying how likely various possible outcomes are.

    <title>Populations vs Samples</title>
    <dl>
        <li>
            <title>subject</title>
            <p>individual entity in a study</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>population</title>
            <p>total set of subjects in which we are interested</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>sample</title>
            <p>subset of population for whom we have data</p>
        </li>
    </dl>
    <p>Learning goal: Be specific and precise about describing these three terms.</p>

    <title>Example: An Exit Poll</title>
    <p>
        The purpose was to predict the outcome of the 2010 gubernatorial election in California.
    </p>
    <p>
        An exit poll sampled 3,889 of the 9.5 million people who voted. Define the sample and the population for this exit poll.

    <title>Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics</title>
    
    <dl>
        <li>
            <title>descriptive statistics</title>
            <p>
                Refers to methods for summarizing the collected data. Summaries consist of graphs and numbers such as averages and percentages.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>inferential statistics</title>
            <p>
                Refers to methods of making decisions or predictions about a population based on data obtained from a sample of that population.
            </p>
        </li>
    </dl>

    <title>Descriptive Example</title>
    <p>
        What makes this descriptive? The graph shows the result of a survey of 743 teenagers (ages 13-17) about their handling of screen time and distraction. (from textbook)

    <title>Inferential Example</title>
    <p>
        What makes this inferential?
    </p>
    <p>
        We'd like to investigate what people think about banning single-use plastic bags from grocery stores. We can study results from a January 2019 poll of 929 New York residents.
    </p>
    <p>
        In that poll, 48% of the sampled subjects said they would support a state law that bans stores from providing plastic bags.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can predict with high confidence (about 95% certainty) that the percentage of all New York voters supporting the ban of plastic bags falls within 4.1% of the survey's value of 48%, that is, between 43.9% and 52.1%.

    <title>Parameter vs Statistic</title>
    
    <dl>
        <li>
            <title>parameter</title>
            <p>a numerical summary for a population</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>statistic</title>
            <p>a numerical summary of a sample taken from the population</p>
        </li>
    </dl>

    <title>Themes to Watch</title>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                randomness and random sampling: essential for using samples to inform us about populations
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                variability: how observations vary
                <ul>
                    <li><p>within a sample: variability among individuals</p></li>
                    <li><p>between samples: variability of statistical results computed from sample</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                margin of error: how close we expect an estimate to fall to the true parameter value
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                statistical significance: measure of the strength of evidence, typically measured by probability or likelihood
            </p>
